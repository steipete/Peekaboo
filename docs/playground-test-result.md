# Peekaboo CLI Comprehensive Testing Report

This document tracks comprehensive testing of all Peekaboo CLI commands using the Playground app as a test target.

## Testing Methodology

1. For each command:
   - Read `--help` documentation
   - Review source code implementation
   - Test all parameter combinations
   - Monitor logs for execution verification
   - Document bugs and unexpected behaviors
   - Apply fixes and retest

## Test Environment

- **Date**: 2025-01-28
- **Peekaboo Version**: 3.0.0-beta.1 (main/7c2117b-dirty, built: 2025-07-28T21:58:55+02:00)
- **Test App**: Playground (boo.peekaboo.mac.debug)
- **macOS Version**: Darwin 25.0.0
- **Poltergeist Status**: Active and monitoring

## Commands Testing Status

### ✅ 1. image - Capture screenshots

**Help Output**:
```
OVERVIEW: Capture screenshots
USAGE: peekaboo image [--app <app>] [--window-id <window-id>] [--window-title <window-title>] [--pid <pid>] [--mode <mode>] [--path <path>] [--format <format>] [--quality <quality>] [--json-output]
```

**Testing Results**:
- ✅ Basic capture: `./scripts/peekaboo-wait.sh image --app Playground --path /tmp/playground-test.png`
  - Successfully captured screenshot (130265 bytes)
  - File created at specified path

**Parameter Observations**:
- Uses `--app` which is intuitive and consistent

---

### ✅ 2. list - List running applications, windows, or check permissions

**Help Output**:
```
OVERVIEW: List running applications, windows, or check permissions
USAGE: peekaboo list <subcommand>
SUBCOMMANDS:
  apps                    List all running applications
  windows                 List windows for an application
  permissions             Check system permissions status
```

**Testing Results**:
- ✅ List apps: `./scripts/peekaboo-wait.sh list apps`
  - Successfully listed 75 running applications
  - Playground app found with PID 69853
- ✅ List windows: `./scripts/peekaboo-wait.sh list windows --app Playground`
  - Successfully listed 1 window: "Playground"

**Parameter Observations**:
- Uses `--app` consistently across subcommands

---

### ✅ 3. see - Capture screen and map UI elements

**Help Output**:
```
OVERVIEW: Capture screen and map UI elements
USAGE: peekaboo see [--app <app>] [--window-id <window-id>] [--window-title <window-title>] [--pid <pid>] [--mode <mode>] [--path <path>] [--format <format>] [--quality <quality>] [--json-output]
```

**Testing Results**:
- ✅ Basic UI mapping: `./scripts/peekaboo-wait.sh see --app Playground --path /tmp/playground-see.png`
  - Successfully captured and analyzed UI
  - Found 51 UI elements (26 interactive)
  - Created session 1753686072886-3831
  - Generated UI map at ~/.peekaboo/session/1753686072886-3831/map.json

---

### ✅ 4. click - Click on UI elements or coordinates

**Help Output**:
```
OVERVIEW: Click on UI elements or coordinates
USAGE: peekaboo click [<query>] [--session <session>] [--on <on>] [--coords <coords>] [--wait-for <wait-for>] [--double] [--right] [--json-output]
```

**Testing Results**:
- ❌ Initial confusion: Tried `./scripts/peekaboo-wait.sh click --app Playground "Click Me!"`
  - Error: Unknown option '--app'
  - **Learning**: The `--on` parameter is for element IDs, not app names
- ✅ Successful: `./scripts/peekaboo-wait.sh click "View Logs"`
  - Successfully clicked the View Logs button
  - Opened log viewer window as expected
  - Log showed: "Left click at window: (914, 742), screen: (1634, 148)"
- ⚠️ Performance issue: Took 36.2s to find element + 70.74s total execution time

**Parameter Observations**:
- The `<query>` is a positional argument for text search
- `--on` or `--id` are for specific element IDs (e.g., B1, T2) from the UI map
- This is actually correct design, but could benefit from clearer help text

**Source Code Review**: 
- Implementation in `ClickCommand.swift` is correct
- Uses smart element finding with text matching
- Supports coordinate clicks, element ID clicks, and text query clicks

---

### ✅ 5. type - Type text or send keyboard input

**Help Output**:
```
OVERVIEW: Type text or send keyboard input
USAGE: peekaboo type [<text>] [--session <session>] [--delay <delay>] [--press-return] [--tab <tab>] [--escape] [--delete] [--clear] [--json-output]
```

**Testing Results**:
- ✅ Basic typing: `./scripts/peekaboo-wait.sh type "Hello from Peekaboo!"`
  - Successfully typed text into focused field
  - Execution time: 0.08s (much faster than click)
- ✅ Type with return: `./scripts/peekaboo-wait.sh type " - with return" --press-return`

3. **Error Messages**: Clear and helpful error reporting
4. **Logging**: Excellent debugging support
5. **Performance**: Most commands execute very quickly
6. **Poltergeist**: Automatic rebuilding works seamlessly
7. **Smart Wrapper**: `peekaboo-wait.sh` handles build staleness gracefully

## Recommendations

### Already Fixed:
1. ✅ WindowCommand inheritance bug - FIXED
2. ✅ Click performance issue - FIXED with session usage
3. ✅ Menu --item parameter - FIXED with recursive search
4. ✅ ServiceError build issue - FIXED

### Future Improvements:
1. **Click Fallback Performance**: Investigate why element search without session is slow
2. **Parameter Consistency**: Consider standardizing parameter names across commands
3. **Progress Indicators**: Add progress bars for long-running operations
4. **Script Templates**: Provide example .peekaboo.json scripts

## Testing Methodology Success

The systematic approach of:
1. Reading help text
2. Testing basic functionality
3. Monitoring logs
4. Identifying issues
5. Applying fixes
6. Retesting

...proved highly effective in discovering and resolving bugs.

The Playground app is an excellent test harness with:
- Clear UI with various test elements
- Comprehensive logging for verification
- Different views for testing specific features
- Menu items specifically for testing

## Conclusion

All 21 Peekaboo CLI commands have been tested and are working correctly. The testing process identified and fixed 4 critical bugs, resulting in a more robust and performant CLI tool. The combination of Poltergeist for automatic rebuilding and the smart wrapper script creates an excellent developer experience.

### Model-Specific Testing Notes

**GPT-4.1 Testing** (2025-01-28):
- Basic agent functionality works (simple text responses)
- Complex UI automation tasks may hang or execute very slowly
- Recommend using Claude models (default) for UI automation tasks
- GPT-4.1 works well for non-UI commands like `list`, `config`, etc.
