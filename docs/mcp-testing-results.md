# MCP Testing Results

## Testing Setup
- **Reloaderoo**: Built from source at `/Users/steipete/Projects/reloaderoo-fork`
- **Peekaboo MCP Server**: Local build at `/Users/steipete/Projects/Peekaboo/Server`
- **Peekaboo CLI**: Binary at `/Users/steipete/Projects/Peekaboo/peekaboo`

## Test Results

### ✅ Hot-Reload Test
- Modified `Server/src/index.ts` to add a log message
- Verified modification was applied after rebuild
- Hot-reload functionality confirmed working

### ✅ Image Capture Tool
- Successfully captured frontmost window to `/tmp/peekaboo-test/screenshot.png`
- Tool correctly identifies application windows
- Returns proper metadata including window title and app name

### ⚠️ Analyze Tool
- Tool requires `PEEKABOO_AI_PROVIDERS` environment variable
- Environment variables need to be passed when starting the server
- Direct parameter-based provider config not yet supported

### ✅ List Tool
- Successfully lists running applications (92 found)
- Provides detailed app information including bundle IDs and PIDs
- Server status shows configuration details

## Available Tools

Based on `list-tools` inspection:

1. **image** - Capture and analyze screen content
   - Supports various targets: screen, app, frontmost
   - Output formats: png, jpg, data (base64)
   - Optional AI analysis with question parameter

2. **analyze** - Analyze existing images with AI
   - Requires image_path and question
   - Supports provider configuration

3. **list** - List system items
   - Types: running_applications, application_windows, server_status
   - Provides detailed window information

4. **see** - Identify UI elements (not yet tested)

5. **click** - Click UI elements

6. **type** - Type text

7. **scroll** - Scroll content

8. **hotkey** - Press keyboard shortcuts

9. **swipe** - Perform swipe gestures

10. **run** - Execute shell commands

11. **sleep** - Add delays

12. **clean** - Clean up resources

13. **agent** - AI agent task execution

14. **app** - Application management

15. **window** - Window management

16. **menu** - Menu interaction

17. **permissions** - Check system permissions

18. **move** - Move mouse cursor

19. **drag** - Drag operations

20. **dialog** - Dialog interaction

21. **space** - Virtual desktop management

22. **dock** - Dock management

## Key Findings

### CLI vs MCP Server Differences

1. **No standalone `analyze` command in CLI** - The analyze functionality has been integrated into:
   - `peekaboo image --analyze "question"` 
   - `peekaboo see --analyze "question"`
   - When calling `peekaboo analyze`, it's incorrectly treated as an agent task

2. **Environment Variables** - The MCP server requires environment variables for configuration:
   - `PEEKABOO_AI_PROVIDERS` - Must be set when starting the server
   - `PEEKABOO_CLI_PATH` - Points to the Peekaboo binary location
   - API keys (OPENAI_API_KEY, ANTHROPIC_API_KEY) must also be in environment

3. **Configuration Files** - The CLI reads from `~/.peekaboo/config.json` but the MCP server does not

## Working Tools Confirmed

- ✅ **image** - Captures screenshots successfully
- ✅ **list** - Lists apps, windows, and server status
- ✅ **sleep** - Simple timing tool works
- ⚠️ **see** - Requires valid window target
- ⚠️ **analyze** - Requires AI provider environment setup

## Next Steps

1. Fix the CLI command recognition bug (add "analyze" to known commands or document removal)
2. Make MCP server read Peekaboo config file for AI providers
3. Test automation tools (click, type, scroll) with proper targets
4. Test error handling scenarios
