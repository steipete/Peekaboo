# TachikomaUI Migration to Peekaboo Mac App

This document describes the migration of TachikomaUI components into the Peekaboo Mac app to enhance its AI capabilities.

## What Was Done

### 1. Extracted TachikomaUI Components ✅

The following components were successfully extracted and adapted for Peekaboo:

#### Core Components
- **`@AI` Property Wrapper** → `Apps/Mac/Peekaboo/Core/AIPropertyWrapper.swift`
  - Reactive AI model integration for SwiftUI
  - Manages conversation state with `@Published` properties
  - Supports streaming, error handling, and cancellation

- **`AIManager`** → Part of `AIPropertyWrapper.swift`
  - Observable object for AI conversation management
  - Handles message history, generation state, errors
  - Integrates with Tachikoma's modern API

#### UI Components
- **`PeekabooChatView`** → `Apps/Mac/Peekaboo/Features/AI/ChatView.swift`
  - Complete chat interface with message bubbles
  - Auto-scrolling, streaming support, error alerts
  - macOS-optimized design with proper focus management

- **`AIAssistantWindow`** → `Apps/Mac/Peekaboo/Features/AI/AIAssistantWindow.swift`
  - Full-featured AI assistant window
  - Model selection, system prompt templates
  - Navigation split view with settings sidebar

- **`CompactAIAssistant`** → Part of `AIAssistantWindow.swift`
  - Compact version suitable for panels/tabs
  - Minimal header with model picker

#### Enhanced Integration
- **`EnhancedSessionDetailView`** → `Apps/Mac/Peekaboo/Features/Main/EnhancedSessionDetailView.swift`
  - Enhanced session view with AI Assistant tab
  - Context-aware system prompts for session analysis
  - Tools usage analysis and Peekaboo command reference

### 2. Cleaned Up Tachikoma ✅

Removed all UI components from Tachikoma to keep it focused on core AI functionality:

- **Removed** `Sources/TachikomaUI/` directory
- **Removed** `Tests/TachikomaUITests/` directory  
- **Updated** `Package.swift` to remove TachikomaUI target and dependencies
- **Verified** `Sources/Tachikoma/Tachikoma.swift` has TachikomaUI imports commented out

### 3. Key Adaptations Made

#### API Compatibility
- **Updated imports**: Uses `TachikomaCore` directly instead of legacy APIs
- **Modern generation functions**: Uses `TachikomaCore.generate()` and `TachikomaCore.stream()` 
- **Model enum**: Uses `Model` instead of `LanguageModel`
- **Tool system**: Adapted for `ToolKit` protocol instead of `SimpleTool` arrays

#### macOS-Specific Enhancements
- **Focus management**: Proper `@FocusState` for text input
- **Auto-scrolling**: Smooth animation during message updates
- **Error handling**: Native macOS alert presentation
- **Keyboard shortcuts**: Submit on Enter, proper text field behavior

#### Integration Points
- **Environment values**: AI model, settings, and tools via SwiftUI environment
- **Session context**: AI assistant understands current Peekaboo sessions
- **Tool integration**: Ready for Peekaboo automation tool integration

## How to Use in Peekaboo Mac App

### 1. Simple AI Chat Component

```swift
import SwiftUI
import TachikomaCore

struct MyView: View {
    var body: some View {
        PeekabooChatView(
            model: .anthropic(.opus4),
            system: "You are a macOS automation expert using Peekaboo.",
            settings: .default,
            tools: nil
        )
    }
}
```

### 2. AI Property Wrapper

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @AI private var ai = AI(
        model: .openai(.gpt4o),
        system: "You are helpful with Peekaboo automation."
    )
    
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            ForEach(ai.conversationMessages, id: \.id) { message in
                MessageBubble(message: message)
            }
            
            Button("Ask AI") {
                Task {
                    await ai.send("How do I automate this task?")
                }
            }
            .disabled(ai.isGenerating)
        }
    }
}
```

### 3. Enhanced Session View

Replace the existing `SessionDetailView` with `EnhancedSessionDetailView` to get:
- **AI Assistant tab** with context-aware prompts
- **Tools analysis** showing which Peekaboo commands were used
- **Session analysis** helping users understand their automation workflows

## Next Steps

### Immediate Integration
1. **Add Tachikoma dependency** to Peekaboo Mac app Xcode project
2. **Replace session detail view** with enhanced version
3. **Add AI Assistant menu item** to main menu bar

### Future Enhancements
1. **Tool integration**: Connect AI assistant to actual Peekaboo automation tools
2. **Session analysis**: AI-powered insights into automation patterns
3. **Smart suggestions**: AI recommendations for workflow improvements
4. **Voice integration**: Combine with existing speech recognition

## Technical Notes

### Dependencies
The migrated components require:
- **TachikomaCore**: For AI generation functions and types
- **SwiftUI**: macOS 14.0+ for modern SwiftUI features
- **Combine**: For reactive programming patterns

### Performance Considerations
- **Lazy loading**: Message lists use `LazyVStack` for efficiency
- **Streaming**: Real-time text updates during AI generation
- **Cancellation**: Proper task cancellation when views disappear

### Architecture Benefits
- **Separation of concerns**: UI components separate from core AI logic
- **Reusability**: Components can be used across different Peekaboo views
- **Testability**: AI logic separate from UI makes testing easier
- **Maintainability**: Clear boundaries between AI and automation functionality

## Migration Status: ✅ Complete

All TachikomaUI functionality has been successfully migrated to Peekaboo Mac app components while removing UI dependencies from Tachikoma core library. The result is a cleaner architecture with powerful AI chat capabilities integrated directly into the Peekaboo user experience.
