# Peekaboo Mac App Modernization Summary

This document summarizes the modernization changes made to the Peekaboo Mac app following Modern Swift guidelines.

## Key Changes

### 1. Adopted @Observable Pattern
- All state classes now use `@Observable` instead of `@ObservableObject`
- Removed unnecessary `@Published` property wrappers
- Simplified state updates with automatic observation

### 2. Simplified State Management
- Removed complex initialization patterns in `PeekabooApp.swift`
- State is now initialized directly with proper dependencies
- Removed unnecessary `setupApp()` method - initialization happens inline

### 3. Improved Code Organization
- Moved `PeekabooAgent.swift` and `AgentEventStream.swift` from `Agent/` folder to `Core/`
- Kept feature-based organization structure
- Removed empty folders

### 4. Simplified PeekabooAgent
- Removed complex retry logic and message queueing
- Removed unused properties and methods
- Simplified error handling
- Made the interface cleaner and more focused

### 5. Modern SwiftUI Patterns
- Used `@Environment` for dependency injection consistently
- Removed unnecessary view models
- Simplified view composition
- Removed duplicate code

### 6. Async/Await Usage
- Kept existing async/await patterns
- Removed unnecessary Task wrappers where not needed
- Fixed async warnings

### 7. Removed Files
- `ViewExtensions.swift` - conflicted with built-in modifiers
- `Agent/` folder - moved contents to Core

## Benefits

1. **Cleaner Code**: Less boilerplate, more focused on functionality
2. **Better Performance**: @Observable provides more efficient updates
3. **Easier Maintenance**: Simpler patterns are easier to understand and modify
4. **Modern Patterns**: Following Apple's latest recommendations
5. **Type Safety**: Maintained strong typing throughout

## Technical Details

- Target: macOS 15.0 (supports all modern Swift features)
- Swift version: 5.0
- Uses SwiftUI's latest features including NavigationSplitView

## Next Steps

Consider further modernization:
1. Simplify SessionStore persistence logic
2. Use SwiftData instead of manual JSON persistence
3. Further simplify the StatusBarController
4. Consider using modern SwiftUI navigation APIs more extensively
