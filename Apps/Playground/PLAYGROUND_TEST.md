   - Apply fixes and retest

## Test Environment

- **Date**: 2025-01-28
- **Peekaboo Version**: 3.0.0-beta.1 (main/7c2117b-dirty, built: 2025-07-28T21:58:55+02:00)
- **Test App**: Playground (boo.peekaboo.mac.debug)
- **macOS Version**: Darwin 25.0.0
- **Poltergeist Status**: Active and monitoring

## Commands Testing Status

  - Successfully captured screenshot (130265 bytes)
  - File created at specified path

**Parameter Observations**:

---

### ✅ 2. list - List running applications, windows, or check permissions

**Help Output**:
```
OVERVIEW: List running applications, windows, or check permissions
USAGE: peekaboo list <subcommand>
SUBCOMMANDS:
  apps                    List all running applications
  windows                 List windows for an application
  permissions             Check system permissions status
```

**Testing Results**:
- ✅ List apps: `./scripts/peekaboo-wait.sh list apps`
  - Successfully listed 75 running applications
  - Playground app found with PID 69853
- ✅ List windows: `./scripts/peekaboo-wait.sh list windows --app Playground`
  - Successfully listed 1 window: "Playground"

**Parameter Observations**:
- Uses `--app` consistently across subcommands

---

### ✅ 3. see - Capture screen and map UI elements

**Help Output**:
```
OVERVIEW: Capture screen and map UI elements
USAGE: peekaboo see [--app <app>] [--window-id <window-id>] [--window-title <window-title>] [--pid <pid>] [--mode <mode>] [--path <path>] [--format <format>] [--quality <quality>] [--json-output]
```

---

### ✅ 4. click - Click on UI elements or coordinates

**Help Output**:
```
OVERVIEW: Click on UI elements or coordinates
USAGE: peekaboo click [<query>] [--session <session>] [--on <on>] [--coords <coords>] [--wait-for <wait-for>] [--double] [--right] [--json-output]
```

**Testing Results**:
- ❌ Initial confusion: Tried `./scripts/peekaboo-wait.sh click --app Playground "Click Me!"`
  - Error: Unknown option '--app'
  - **Learning**: The `--on` parameter is for element IDs, not app names
- ✅ Successful: `./scripts/peekaboo-wait.sh click "View Logs"`
  - Successfully clicked the View Logs button
  - Opened log viewer window as expected
  - Log showed: "Left click at window: (914, 742), screen: (1634, 148)"
- ⚠️ Performance issue: Took 36.2s to find element + 70.74s total execution time

**Parameter Observations**:
- The `<query>` is a positional argument for text search
- `--on` is for specific element IDs (e.g., B1, T2) from the UI map
- This is actually correct design, but could benefit from clearer help text

**Source Code Review**: 
- Implementation in `ClickCommand.swift` is correct
- Uses smart element finding with text matching
- Supports coordinate clicks, element ID clicks, and text query clicks

3. **Progress Indicators**: Add progress bars for long-running operations
4. **Script Templates**: Provide example .peekaboo.json scripts

## Testing Methodology Success

The systematic approach of:
1. Reading help text
2. Testing basic functionality
3. Monitoring logs
4. Identifying issues
5. Applying fixes
6. Retesting

...proved highly effective in discovering and resolving bugs.

The Playground app is an excellent test harness with:
